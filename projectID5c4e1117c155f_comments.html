<HTML><BODY>One good thing about newer books is that they become more relevant to our current lives. That is why it is such a shame copyright locks up books for far too long, and why it is nice we can finally have a renewed input of books going into the roaring 20's.

<p>Maybe nothing spells modern times more than mass tourism, and motor camping, that is using your car to go out in nature to set up a tent and stay in primitive conditions is such a modern thing: for most of history, the idea alone would have been unthinkable -- or simply unaffordable for most but the very rich.

</p><p>This books describes the early days, when the T-ford was still current, and most camping sites where free. Includes drawings of very simple tents, ways to convert your T-ford into a place for the night, and even folding trailers, and a 1920's precursor of that real American thing, the motorhome. I Would love to travel in that one, BTW.
